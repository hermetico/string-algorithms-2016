## How to run this scripts
* To test the correctness of the algorithms just run

```
python exact_pattern_matching/exact_pattern_matching.py
```

* To run the rest of the experiments just run

```
python tests.py

This will create some files in the folder plots_outputs with the data. If you want to run a test in particular, just
open the file tests.py and at the bottom of the file, comment the tests you do not want to run

* To run the tests with the naive cpp version just tun (you may need to compile the naive.cpp file)

```
python test_naive.py
```
